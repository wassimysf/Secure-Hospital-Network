# Design and Implementation of a Secure Healthcare Information Network System

This repository contains the **Design and Implementation of a Secure Healthcare Information Network System** for a multi-floor healthcare organization. The project ensures **secure, scalable, and efficient networking** to support medical services, communication, and data handling.

---

## Project Overview

The healthcare company operates across three floors, handling medical tests and digitizing services for over **2,120 users**. The network architecture integrates **cloud computing**, **wireless networks**, **VoIP systems**, and robust **firewall configurations**, ensuring secure access and reliable communication across departments.

- **DHCP Server** configuration for dynamic IP assignments
- **SSH** with Access Control Lists (ACLs) for secure management
- **OSPF** routing protocol
- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)** for failover and redundancy
- **Firewall Basic Levels and Zone Configurations**
- **Firewall NAT Configurations**
- **Firewall Default Route Configurations**
- **Firewall Inspection Policies**
- **Standard and Extended ACLs** for traffic control
- **VoIP Configurations** on Cisco Voice Gateway routers
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** and **Lightweight Access Points** for wireless networking
- **Wireless Network** deployment for staff and guests
- **EtherChannel** using the **LACP method**
- **STP PortFast** and **BPDUguard** for switch security
- **Static IPv4 Addressing** and **Subnetting**
- **Host Configurations** for devices like PCs, IP phones, and servers
